Salt is not only a thrilling spy action movie, but also a movie that challenges the gender stereotypes in Hollywood. The movie was originally written with a male protagonist, Edwin A. Salt, and Tom Cruise was approached to play him. However, he backed out and the script was rewritten with a female lead, Evelyn Salt, and Angelina Jolie was cast[^1^]. Jolie did most of her own stunts in the movie, proving that she can handle the physical demands of an action hero[^1^]. The movie also subverted the expectations of having a female spy as a mother or a love interest, as Evelyn Salt was neither[^2^].
 
The movie also has some interesting connections to real-life events and history. The character of Salt is named after the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (S.A.L.T.), which were negotiations between the USA and the Soviet Union during the Cold War to limit their nuclear weapons[^1^]. The movie also references the real-life Russian spy ring that was exposed in 2010, shortly before the movie's release[^3^]. The movie also features some authentic locations and details, such as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC), which was based on a German government bunker[^1^], and the Russian tricolor pennant on Salt's desk, which indicates that she participated in the war campaign in Chechnya[^1^].
 
Salt is a movie that has something for everyone: action, suspense, drama, and twists. It is a movie that showcases Angelina Jolie's talent and charisma as an actress and an action star. It is also a movie that explores the themes of identity, loyalty, and betrayal in a complex and unpredictable world. If you are looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you question everything you see, you should watch Salt (2010) DIRECTORS CUT 1080p BRRip x264 AAC-YiFY.
